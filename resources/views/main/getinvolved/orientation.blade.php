            To become a English Pour Tout Le Monde volunteer, you will begin by attending one of our orientation sessions. We hold orientation sessions twice a month; one evening and one morning.</p>

        <ul>


            <li>Wednesday 4th December at 7:30am : Le Grande Breguet Cafe</li></ul>

        <br><br>
        <p> We will cover the following topics in the orientation session: </p><br>
        <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">

            <li class="list-group-item">An introduction to EPTLMâ€™s history, objectives and our core team</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Explanation of our volunteering opportunities</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Guidance for volunteering with EPTLM</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Group discussion of ideas!</li>
        </ul>

        <p> <br>We will give all attendees our official documentation; volunteer guidelines and safeguarding forms.
            <br> <br>
            Our orientation sessions are a relaxed get together, serving not only as a chance to learn more about EPTLM but also for new and existing volunteers and EPTLM team members to socialise.</p>
